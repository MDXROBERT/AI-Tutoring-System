Fully connected layers at the end perform classification or regression. Their architecture makes them robust against translation and distortion in images. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) use convolutional layers that apply filters to the input data to extract spatial features, followed by pooling layers that reduce dimensionality.    Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) represent a breakthrough architecture in deep learning, specifically designed to process data with grid-like topology, such as images. Inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex, CNNs automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features through backpropagation.\n\nThe fundamental building blocks of a CNN include:\n\n Convolutional layers: These layers apply learned filters (kernels) to input data through a convolution operation. Each filter slides across the input, computing dot products to detect specific features at different locations. This operation enables CNNs to capture local patterns with spatial invariance. Mathematically, the convolution operation can be expressed as:\n   (f * g)(x,y) = \u2211\u2211f(i,j)\u00b7g(x-i,y-j)\n   where f is the input and g is the kernel.\n\n Activation functions: Non-linear functions like ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) are applied after convolutions to introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns. ReLU is defined as f(x) = max(0,x), which replaces negative values with zero while keeping positive values unchanged.\n\n Pooling layers: These reduce the spatial dimensions (width and height) of the data, decreasing computational load and providing a form of translation invariance. Common pooling operations include max pooling (taking the maximum value in a region) and average pooling (computing the average value).\n\n Fully connected layers: Usually placed at the end of the network, these layers connect every neuron from the previous layer to each neuron in the current layer, performing classification or regression based on the features extracted by earlier layers.\n\nThe architecture of a CNN creates a hierarchy of features: early layers detect simple features like edges and corners, middle layers combine these to recognize motifs and textures, and deeper layers identify complex objects and scenes. This hierarchical learning is what makes CNNs so powerful for visual understanding tasks.\n\nCNNs offer several key advantages:\n- Parameter sharing: Each filter is applied across the entire input, significantly reducing the number of parameters compared to fully connected networks\n- Sparse connectivity: Each output value depends only on a small local region of the input, further decreasing parameter count"}
